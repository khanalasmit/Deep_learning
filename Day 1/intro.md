**What is deep Learning?**
----------------------------
Deep learning is a subfield of AI and machine learning that is inspired by the structure of human brain.\
Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called Neural Networks.\

**Why DL getting so famous?**
---------------------------------
1. Applicability
2. Performance

_______________________________________
- Deep learning is a pary of broader family of machine learning methods based on artificail neural networks with representation learning.
- Representation learning is a set of techiniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representation needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.
- uses the multiple layers

**Deep learning vs machine learning**
--------------------------------------
1. Data dependency: Deep learning need large amount of data then the machine learning algorithm.
2. Hardware dependency: Deep learning need larger Hardware.
3. Training time: DL need more
4. Feature selection: Deep learning can automatically extract feature called represenation learning. The layered architectue extract the low level to complex to fatures.
5. Interpretablity: Deep learning is the black box thus the deep learning has low interpretablity.
